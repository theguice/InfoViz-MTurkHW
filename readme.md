##Instructions

###Setup
1. Clone this repository to your computer.
2. Open "bar-chart.html" in your browser.
3. Open "line-chart.html" & "line-chart-ajax.html" in your text editor.

###Goals
You are building two line charts using the same data as the one shown in the bar chart example. The first one reads the data inline & the second one reads the data from an external csv file. Take a look at result-line-chart.png & result-line-chart-ajax.png to see what the final results should look like.

###Practice with Highcharts
1. Work on line-chart.html
2. Create a line chart from scratch. Use the bar chart example & http://www.highcharts.com/demo/line-basic as your starting point.
3. You only need to edit the script--no need to edit the HTML or CSS.

###Practice with Highcharts & jQuery

2. Work on line-chart-ajax.html
3. Follow the specific instructions outlined in line-chart-ajax.html.
4. You only need to edit the script--no need to edit the HTML or CSS.
